# Threefold Staging app

### iOS installation

- Install the **TestFlight** app from the [iPhone AppStore](https://itunes.apple.com/be/app/testflight/id899247664).
- Open the TestFlight app and connect your Apple ID (you will receive an email with verification link).
- Contact `@bart_pede` on Telegram to invite you as TestFlight tester. Give him your Apple ID.
  - Your Apple ID is visible at the bottom of the screen in the TestFlight app.
- As soon as you've been added, you will receive a first invitation email to become a member in iTunesConnect.
- After accepting this first invitation, contact `@bart_pede` again. Now he can invite you to start testing the "ThreeFold Staging" app. A second invitation will be sent via email.
  - Opening this email on your iPhone is the easiest, because the button in the email jumps right into the TestFlight app.
  - If you open the email on your pc/laptop, then you can add the app to TestFlight by redeeming an invitation code.
- After accepting the second invitation, you can install/update the "ThreeFold Staging" app from the TestFlight app.
  - Warning: apps in TestFlight are only valid for 3 months, so if the Staging app suddenly crashes when opening, then probably the app version has passed those 3 months. Check if there is an update available in the TestFlight app. If not, contact `@bart_pede` to publish an update.
